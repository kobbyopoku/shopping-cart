# shopping-cart

When shopping for groceries online a Customer chooses a Product and places an Order for some quantity of it.
The order is added to a Cart. A Date is set for the delivery. More orders can be added to the cart, and they can be changed up until checking out.
It is possible for products to have a discount rate applied, i.e. a DiscountProduct. The contents of the shopping cart can be sorted in various ways. 
Orders within a cart can be iterated over. To support further features of the cart, orders and associated products can be tested for equality.
