//        UC2 - Test each of the sort methods work as expected, as evidenced by appropriate output.
//        â€¢ For the sortOrders(Comparator<Order>) method, you should pass in a custom comparator that sorts by cost
//        (asc) and if these are the same then by product (desc).


//        UC3 - Additionally, test the use of equality by using the contains and remove methods. Also, you should use a
//        PrintWriter to produce a receipt for all of the orders and associated details of the cart, and output these
//        into a text file Cart.txt.


//        UC4 - Add further code to show how each method of Cart can be used. In particular, increase and/or decrease
//        the quantity of one or more of the products in the cart, and then re-print the updated cart listing.
